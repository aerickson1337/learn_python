# TODO ITEMS Project 1

- add a `main()` function and a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- rewrite lines 8-16 to be a function named "check_if_customer_is_evil" that takes "name" as a parameter. Call that function instead of using lines 8-16 directly.
- rewrite `if name == "Ben" or "Maia" or "Loki"` to use a list named "known_evil_customers" and the `in` operator.
- Make your menu on line 18 a list. Add a type hint that this variable is a list.
- use `'\n'.join()` to print your menu on line 21
- Add a way for the customer to change their mind on line 31-32 after they hear it's two more dollars for whipped cream.
- Convert any non f-string `print()` statements to instead use an f-string
