# TODO ITEMS Project 4

- Make a function for printing the menu_dict
- add another parameter to `_get_sanitized_input` that allows for returning integers instead of sanitized strings
- Convert existing _get_sanitized_input calls that want integers returned to use the new parameter
- On line 72 prompt the user with the menu again after telling them their menu_number isn't valid.
