# TODO ITEMS Project 2

- Add handling for the customer entering both "latte" or "Latte", "yes" or "Yes", etc.
- Add handling for the customer accidently adding a space to the end of their order. "Latte " instead of "Latte".
- Write a function called "_get_sanitized_input" that you can call instead of "input" to handle this for all customer input instead of doing it everywhere.
